**pyLoad Next** is the newest version of pyLoad.

Developed in the [main branch](https://github.com/pyload/pyload/tree/main) on GitHub and deployed as `pyload-ng` on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyload-ng/), works on Python 3.6+ and is currently in alpha phase.

The old stable version of pyLoad resides in the [stable branch](https://github.com/pyload/pyload/tree/stable) and is compatible with Python 2 only.

## Quick Start

Open a terminal window and install pyLoad typing:

    pip install --pre pyload-ng[all]

To start pyLoad use the command:

    pyload

See the [usage section](#usage) for information on all available options.

If you want to uninstall pyLoad:

    pip uninstall pyload-ng

## Advanced Installation

### Stable Release

Get the latest stable release of pyLoad:

    pip install pyload-ng

> **Note**:
> No stable release is available. pyLoad is still in pre-release phase.

#### Available modules

- `pyload.core`: pyLoad's heart.
- `pyload.plugins`: the collection of officially supported plugins for pyLoad.
- `pyload.webui`: a web interface to interact with pyLoad.

### Development Release

You can force the installation of the latest development release of pyLoad,
appending the option `--pre` to the installation command:

    pip install --pre pyload-ng

**Do not use development releases in production**. Unexpected crashes may occur.

### Extra Dependencies

Extra dependencies are non-essential packages that extend or unlock some features of pyLoad.

To install them you have to append a specific tag name to the installation command.

#### Available tags

- `plugins`: packages required by some plugins to work.
- `build`: packages required to [build translations](#build-translations).
- `all`: shortcut to apply all available tags.

You can use a tag in this way:

    pip install pyload-ng[plugins]

Or group more together:

    pip install pyload-ng[plugins][build]

### Build Translations

> **Note**:
> You don't have to build the translations files if you installed pyLoad through `pip`,
> because they're already included.

Use the command `build_locale` to retrieve and build the latest locale files (translations):

    python setup.py build_locale

Invoke `build_locale` before building the package (eg. `bdist_wheel`).

## Usage

    usage: pyload [-h] [--version] [-d] [--userdir USERDIR] [--tempdir TEMPDIR]
                  [--daemon] [--restore]

    The free and open-source Download Manager written in pure Python

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help               show this help message and exit
      --version                show program's version number and exit
      -d, --debug              enable debug mode
      --userdir USERDIR        use this location to store user data files
      --tempdir TEMPDIR        use this location to store temporary files
      --storagedir STORAGEDIR  use this location to save downloads
      --daemon                 run as daemon
      --restore                reset default username/password

To start pyLoad, type the command:

    pyload

This will create the following directories (if they don't exist already):

- `~/Downloads/pyLoad`: where downloads will be saved.
- `~/.pyload`: where user data (configuration files) are stored.
- `<TMPDIR>/pyLoad`: where temporary files are stored. `<TMPDIR>` is [platform-specific](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.gettempdir).

> **Note**:
> On Windows, user data are saved by default in the directory `~\AppData\Roaming\pyLoad`.

### Help

To show an overview of the available options, type:

    pyload --help

### Web Interface

Open your web browser and visit the url http://localhost:8000 to have access to
the pyLoad's web interface.

- Default username: `pyload`.
- Default password: `pyload`.

**It's highly recommended to change the default access credentials on first start**.

[![MicroBadger size](https://img.shields.io/microbadger/image-size/pyload/pyload)](https://microbadger.com/images/pyload/pyload)

#### Available images

- `pyload/pyload:ubuntu`: default docker image of pyLoad (amd64, arm, arm64v8).
- `pyload/pyload:ubuntu-arm32v7`: default docker image of pyLoad (arm32v7).
- `pyload/pyload:alpine`: alternative docker image of pyLoad (maybe smaller).
- `pyload/pyload`: alias of `pyload/pyload:ubuntu`.

### Create Container

    docker create --name=pyload -v <USERDIR>:/config -v <STORAGEDIR>:/downloads --restart unless-stopped pyload/pyload

Replace `<STORAGEDIR>` with the location on the host machine where you want that downloads will be saved.

Replace `<USERDIR>` with where you want that user data files (configurations) are stored.

### Start Container

    docker start pyload

### Stop Container

    docker stop pyload

### Show Logs

    docker logs -f pyload

### Docker Compose

Compatible with `docker-compose` v2 schemas:

    ---
    version: 2
    services:
      pyload:
        image: pyload/pyload
        container_name: pyload
        environment:
          - PUID=1000
          - PGID=1000
          - TZ=Europe/London
        volumes:
          - <USERDIR>:/config
          - <STORAGEDIR>:/downloads
        ports:
          - 8000:8000
        restart: unless-stopped

Replace `<STORAGEDIR>` with the location on the host machine where you want that downloads will be saved.

Replace `<USERDIR>` with where you want that user data files (configurations) are stored.

## Troubleshooting

### pip not found

Retry replacing the command `pip` with `pip3`:

    pip3 install pyload-ng

If fails again, you may not have the Python interpreter
or the pip package manager installed on your system.

Try reinstalling Python to fix this issue.

Visit https://www.python.org/downloads
to get the proper **Python 3** release for your system.

### pyload-ng not found

Check the version of the Python interpreters installed on your system.

To show the version of your **default** Python interpreter, type the command:

    python --version

If the version is too old, try to upgrage Python, then you can retry to install pyLoad.

Python releases below version 3.6 are not supported!

### Setuptools is too old

To upgrade the `setuptools` package, type the command:

    pip install --upgrade setuptools

### Permission denied

Under Unix-based systems, try to install pyLoad with root privileges.

Prefix the installation/uninstallation command with `sudo`:

    sudo pip install pyload-ng



    sudo pip uninstall pyload-ng

Under Windows systems, open a _Command Prompt as administrator_ to install pyLoad
with root privileges.

You can also try to install the `pyload-ng` package **without** root privileges.

Append the option `--user` to the installation command:

    pip install --user pyload-ng
